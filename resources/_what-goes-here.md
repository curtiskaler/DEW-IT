# resources/ #

A folder for non-code things to be packaged with the release.

> **NOTE** that package-specific resources should be included in the respective package. 
> For example, client-specific icon images should be included somewhere in the client project folders.
> This folder is for resources that are not package-specific, or are specific to final packaging / installers.
