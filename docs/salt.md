## Salty Definitions ##

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|"MVFU"| There are lots of design/architecture philosophies. This design is based partially on MVC, partially on MVVM, and partially on my own experiences. I haven't yet gelled on a pattern where I can dictate the definition yet. |
| "Best Practices" | 1. "I'm lazy, and an idiot." <br> 2. A fantastical set of activities that appear to separate leading organizations from the rest of the pack. The fantasy is that, once identified, these practices can be adopted by other organizations, which will then experience similar gains in performance. <br> In reality, organizations are complex configurations of people and technology, and a set of tools or practices that work well in one context are not guaranteed to be effective for another organization. Practices may be exportable between teams, but how *helpful* they are is affected by many factors, including the organization, tools, policies, OTHER existing practices, support, etc. <br> Typically invoked as an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) where there exists no actual authority.<br> "Best practices" could most charitably be described as "practices that this team found helpful". |
| "Industry Standards" | "I'm lazy, and an idiot." (See "best practices".) |
| "Why?" | The most important question. <br> If you suggest that I do `x`, and I ask you 'why' I should do `x`, and you cannot provide a satisfying reason, then please do expect me to ignore that input. (As noted above, "best practices", and "industry standards" are neither satisfying nor helpful. Get out of here with that garbage.) |
